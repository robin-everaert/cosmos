                    On a rainy Sunday, while feeling a bit bored, I stumbled upon NASA's API.
                    I've been passionate about astronomy and development since I was young, so it felt natural to make the most of this discovery.

                    This application, built with Vue.js 3, showcases the most relevant information from NASA's offerings, as seen through my eyes.
